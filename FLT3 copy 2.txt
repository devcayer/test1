# The Impact of FLT3 Overexpression on Disease Prevalence, Manifestation, and Intensity in Hematological Malignancies

## Introduction

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the normal development of hematopoietic stem cells and immune cells. Aberrations in the expression and function of FLT3, particularly through mutations, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies, most notably acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This report examines the association between FLT3 overexpression and its impact on disease prevalence, manifestation, and intensity, with a focus on AML and breast cancer (BC), drawing upon recent research findings.

## FLT3 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

### Prevalence and Mutations

FLT3 is the most frequently mutated gene in AML, with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations being associated with a more aggressive clinical course (Nature, 2023). The incidence of FLT3 mutations, particularly FLT3-ITD, increases with age, driven by the overall higher incidences of new AML cases in older patients (Nature, 2023). Despite a decrease in the proportion of AML cases harboring FLT3-ITD mutations with age, the absolute incidence of FLT3-ITD-mutated AML rises due to the higher incidence of AML in the older population (Nature, 2023).

### Manifestation and Intensity

FLT3-ITD mutations are consistently associated with a more aggressive phenotype and worse survival in AML (Nature, 2023). A higher allelic ratio of FLT3-ITD is linked to inferior outcomes, particularly when frontline FLT3 inhibitors are not used (Nature, 2023). In younger adults with AML treated intensively, the prognostic impact of FLT3 mutations is well-established, but studies in older patients show less consistent results (Nature, 2023). In patients over 60 years of age, FLT3-ITD mutations have been associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (Nature, 2023). However, the negative impact of FLT3-ITD mutations in intensively treated older adults with newly diagnosed AML is not consistently observed across studies, which may be due to smaller patient numbers and underpowered analyses in some studies (Nature, 2023).

### FLT3-TKD Mutations

FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations have shown no or only minimal prognostic impact in most studies (Nature, 2023). A meta-analysis of 20 prospective cohort studies found that FLT3-TKD had no significant effect on DFS and OS in general, but patient ethnicity contributed to the heterogeneity observed in the prognosis of FLT3-TKD in AML (PubMed, 2023). Specifically, FLT3-TKD represented a beneficial prognosis for DFS and OS in Asian patients, whereas it represented an adverse prognosis of DFS for Caucasian patients with AML (PubMed, 2023).

## FLT3 in Breast Cancer (BC)

### Prevalence and Prognostic Factor

FLT3 displays elevated expression in BC compared to normal pairs and is significantly associated with multiple clinical characteristics such as age, menopause status, histological type, pathological stage, and molecular subtype, as well as increased OS (NCBI, 2023). FLT3 is a favorable independent prognostic factor in BC, suggesting that its overexpression is associated with a better prognosis (NCBI, 2023).

### Immune-Related Features

FLT3 expression in BC is correlated with the abundance of various immune cells and immune inhibitors, such as CTLA4, which is positively correlated with FLT3 expression (NCBI, 2023). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) displayed a negative correlation with FLT3 expression, while immunophenoscore (IPS) showed an adverse tendency (NCBI, 2023). The methylation of FLT3 downregulates gene expression and is closely related to clinical parameters (NCBI, 2023).

## Discussion

The overexpression and mutation of FLT3 have distinct implications in AML and BC. In AML, FLT3 overexpression, particularly due to FLT3-ITD mutations, is associated with a more aggressive disease course and poorer survival outcomes. This association is less clear in older adults, where the impact of FLT3 mutations on prognosis has been inconsistent. In contrast, in BC, FLT3 overexpression is associated with favorable clinical characteristics and improved survival outcomes, indicating a potential protective role.

The divergent roles of FLT3 in AML and BC highlight the complexity of its function in different types of cancer. In AML, FLT3 overexpression and mutations are clearly linked to disease intensity and poor prognosis, making FLT3 a critical target for therapeutic intervention. The use of FLT3 inhibitors, such as midostaurin and gilteritinib, has shown survival benefits, although resistance remains a challenge (PubMed, 2023; JHO Online, 2023). In BC, the positive correlation between FLT3 expression and immune cell abundance suggests a role in immune-mediated anti-tumor responses, which may contribute to the observed improved prognosis (NCBI, 2023).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, FLT3 overexpression is associated with greater disease intensity in AML, particularly in the presence of FLT3-ITD mutations. In BC, FLT3 overexpression is associated with a favorable prognosis, potentially due to its involvement in immune-related pathways. These findings underscore the importance of context-dependent roles of FLT3 in cancer biology and the need for targeted therapeutic strategies that consider the specific disease context and patient demographics.

## Introduction

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has been extensively studied for its role in the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The significance of FLT3 in oncology is underscored by its frequent mutations in AML, which are associated with poor prognosis and aggressive disease phenotypes. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the association of FLT3 with oncology, with a focus on its role in AML, based on the latest research and clinical findings.

## FLT3 in Oncology: A Focus on Acute Myeloid Leukemia

FLT3 mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in AML, identified in approximately one-third of newly diagnosed patients (National Cancer Institute, 2021). These mutations include internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD), both of which lead to constitutive activation of the FLT3 signaling pathway, promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival (Small, 2006).

### Prognostic Significance of FLT3 Mutations in AML

The presence of FLT3-ITD mutations in AML is associated with increased relapse rates and inferior overall survival (OS) (Levis, 2011). Studies have shown that FLT3-ITD mutations are poor prognostic indicators at diagnosis, although they are not considered an independent prognostic factor (Chillón et al., 2004). Conversely, the prognostic impact of FLT3-TKD mutations is less clear, with some studies suggesting a negative effect on disease-free survival (DFS) and OS, particularly in Caucasian populations (Thiede et al., 2002; Whitman et al., 2008).

A meta-analysis of 20 prospective cohort studies involving 10,970 AML patients revealed that FLT3-TKD mutations did not significantly affect DFS or OS in general. However, patient ethnicity appeared to influence the prognostic effect, with FLT3-TKD representing a beneficial prognosis for Asian patients but an adverse prognosis for Caucasian patients (Frontiers in Oncology, 2023).

### FLT3 Inhibitors in AML Treatment

The development of FLT3 inhibitors has been a significant advancement in the treatment of AML. Midostaurin and gilteritinib are two FLT3 inhibitors currently approved in the United States, with several others in clinical trials (National Cancer Institute, 2021). These inhibitors have shown efficacy in reducing the leukemic burden, but resistance remains a challenge, often due to secondary FLT3 mutations, upregulation of parallel pathways, and extracellular signaling (Levis, 2011).

Novel FLT3 inhibitors, such as NMS-03592088, have demonstrated activity in patients with prior FLT3 inhibitor experience, indicating progress in overcoming resistance mechanisms (American Association for Cancer Research, 2023). The future of FLT3-targeted therapy may involve combinations with other agents to address resistance and improve patient outcomes (National Cancer Institute, 2021).

### FLT3 Beyond AML: Other Oncological and Non-Oncological Roles

While FLT3 is predominantly associated with AML, its role extends to other oncological and non-oncological contexts. FLT3 ligand (FLT3L) has been implicated in the development of dendritic cells (DCs) and has shown potential as an immunostimulatory antitumor agent (National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2016). Additionally, FLT3 mutations have been linked to the immune response in AML patients, with an inverse association between FLT3 mutations and levels of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), suggesting a role in immune evasion (National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2021).

## Discussion

The evidence clearly establishes FLT3 as a critical player in the oncology landscape, particularly within the realm of AML. Its mutations serve as biomarkers for aggressive disease and poor prognosis, and FLT3 inhibitors have become integral components of AML treatment regimens. However, the challenge of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors necessitates ongoing research and development of novel therapeutic strategies.

The association of FLT3 with patient ethnicity and its differential prognostic impact highlight the complexity of its role in AML and the need for personalized approaches to treatment. Furthermore, the potential applications of FLT3-targeted therapies in immunomodulation and other cancers warrant further investigation.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, FLT3 is predominantly associated with oncology, specifically with AML, where it plays a significant role in disease progression and therapeutic targeting. The development of FLT3 inhibitors has marked a significant milestone in AML treatment, although resistance to these agents remains a significant hurdle. Future research should focus on understanding the mechanisms of resistance, exploring the role of FLT3 in other cancers, and investigating its potential in immunotherapy.

## Introduction

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), also known as FLK2 (fetal liver tyrosine kinase 2), STK-1 (stem cell tyrosine kinase 1), or CD135, is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays a pivotal role in the normal development of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of FLT3, focusing on its classification, cellular and physiological localization, and its role within the body, particularly in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

## Classification of FLT3

FLT3 belongs to the class III family of RTKs, which includes other members such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), KIT (stem cell factor receptor), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor. Structurally, FLT3 comprises several domains: an N-terminal extracellular region with five immunoglobulin-like subdomains, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane (JM) domain, and an intracellular C-terminal kinase domain consisting of two substructures (N-lobe and C-lobe) connected by an activation-loop (A-loop) (Nature Reviews Cancer, 2003; BMC Chemistry, 2023).

## Localization of FLT3 in the Body and Within a Cell

### Physiological Localization

FLT3 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues but can also be detected in non-hematopoietic tissues such as the brain, testis, and placenta. Its expression is selective, primarily found on CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid as well as B-lymphoid progenitors, while it is absent in erythroid progenitors. The FLT3 ligand (FL), which activates the receptor, is expressed ubiquitously except in the brain, indicating that the expression pattern of the receptor is the limiting factor in determining tissue specificity (Journal of Hematology & Oncology, 2023).

### Cellular Localization

FLT3 is a transmembrane protein that undergoes a complex glycosylation process, resulting in a mature 150 kDa protein that is localized within the cellular membrane. The wild-type FLT3 protein is mainly localized within the cellular membrane, while trafficking is directed by stepwise glycosylation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA). In contrast, FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations (FLT3-ITD) are significantly retained in the ER/GA system due to impaired post-translational processing and reduced glycosylation of the immature 130 kDa FLT3-ITD protein. The intracellular localization of FLT3-ITD defines which downstream signaling pathways are constitutively activated by FLT3-ITD (Blood, 2009; Blood, 2021).

## Physiological Role of FLT3

FLT3 plays an essential role in hematopoietic progenitor cell survival and proliferation. Binding of FLT3 ligand leads to FLT3 receptor dimerization, conformational change, autophosphorylation, and stimulation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. These pathways are crucial for the life cycle of a cell, from differentiation to apoptosis. Normally, after FL binds to the FLT3 extracellular domain, the RTK is dimerized and subsequently phosphorylated, becoming activated. This further activates downstream signaling cascades such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and rat sarcoma (RAS) signal-transduction cascades, leading to hematopoietic cell maturation and proliferation (Nature Reviews Cancer, 2003; Blood, 2021).

## FLT3 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

In AML, FLT3 mutations are the most common genetic alteration, identified in approximately one-third of newly diagnosed patients. FLT3-ITD mutations are associated with increased relapse and inferior overall survival. The mutant forms of FLT3, which include point mutations in the kinase domain or internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in or near the juxtamembrane domain, do not require FL for activation and can localize both to an intracellular compartment as well as to the plasma membrane. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the kinase, promoting uncontrolled proliferation and survival of AML blasts (Leukemia, 2019; Blood Cancer Journal, 2021).

## Therapeutic Targeting of FLT3

The high frequency of FLT3 mutations and their adverse effect on prognosis make FLT3 a promising therapeutic target. Several FLT3 inhibitors have been developed, with midostaurin and gilteritinib currently approved for use. These inhibitors target the FLT3 signaling pathway, aiming to inhibit the uncontrolled proliferation of AML cells. However, resistance to FLT3 inhibitors through secondary FLT3 mutations, upregulation of parallel pathways, and extracellular signaling remains a challenge. Novel therapeutic strategies, including combining FLT3 inhibitors with other antileukemic agents and FLT3-directed immunotherapy, are in active clinical development (Leukemia, 2019; Blood, 2021).

## Conclusion

FLT3 is a class III RTK that is crucial for the normal development of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. It is primarily localized within the cellular membrane and plays a significant role in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation through activation of downstream signaling pathways. In the context of AML, FLT3 mutations result in constitutive activation of the kinase, contributing to the aggressive nature of the disease. Targeting FLT3 mutations with specific inhibitors has become a cornerstone in the treatment of AML, although challenges with resistance continue to drive research for more effective therapies.

## Executive Summary

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a devastating hematological malignancy characterized by the rapid proliferation of abnormal myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood. A critical driver of AML in a significant subset of patients is the mutation of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene. FLT3 mutations, particularly the internal tandem duplication (ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations, are associated with a poor prognosis due to their role in the aggressive growth of leukemia cells. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the companies that are at the forefront of developing FLT3 modulation therapeutics, aiming to improve the treatment landscape and outcomes for patients with FLT3-mutated AML.

## Introduction

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a devastating hematological malignancy characterized by the rapid proliferation of abnormal myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood, leading to impaired hematopoiesis and bone marrow failure. Among the genetic aberrations associated with AML, mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are one of the most common and clinically significant. FLT3 mutations, particularly the internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD), are associated with a poor prognosis due to their role in driving leukemic cell proliferation and survival. This report delves into the specific biological pathway associated with FLT3 and the proteins closely related to its biological function, with a focus on the latest research findings.

## FLT3 Signaling Pathway

FLT3 is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in the normal development of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. The receptor is composed of an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like motifs, a transmembrane helix, a juxtamembrane (JM) domain, and an intracellular kinase domain divided into N and C lobes with an activation loop (Darici et al., 2020; Takahashi, 2011). In its inactive state, the JM domain binds to the N lobe of the kinase domain, stabilizing the activation loop in a closed configuration. Upon binding of the FLT3 ligand, the receptor dimerizes, leading to autophosphorylation and a conformational change that shifts the JM domain out of its autoinhibitory position. This exposes the ATP binding site and activates the receptor (Gilliland & Griffin, 2002; Hayakawa et al., 2000).

The activation of FLT3 triggers several downstream signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and STAT5 pathways, which are critical for cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (Darici et al., 2020; Wingelhofer et al., 2018; Takahashi, 2011). These pathways are tightly regulated under normal physiological conditions but become constitutively activated in the presence of FLT3 mutations, such as FLT3-ITD, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and the pathogenesis of AML (Takahashi, 2011; Gilliland & Griffin, 2002; Hayakawa et al., 2000).

## Interacting Proteins and Mechanisms

### STAT5

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is a critical downstream effector of FLT3 signaling. FLT3-ITD mutations have been shown to constitutively activate STAT5, which translocates to the nucleus and promotes the transcription of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation (Hayakawa et al., 2000; Rocnik et al., 2006). The activation of STAT5 is a hallmark of FLT3-ITD-driven leukemogenesis and represents a potential therapeutic target (Wingelhofer et al., 2018).

### PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway

The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is another major downstream effector of FLT3. This pathway regulates cell growth, survival, and metabolism. FLT3-ITD mutations lead to the hyperactivation of this pathway, contributing to the oncogenic potential of leukemic cells (Darici et al., 2020). The mTOR complex, in particular, is a central component that integrates signals from FLT3 and other growth factors to modulate protein synthesis and cell growth.

### MAPK/ERK Pathway

The MAPK/ERK pathway is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. FLT3-ITD mutations result in the persistent activation of this pathway, which supports the proliferation of leukemic cells (Hayakawa et al., 2000). The RAS/MAPK signaling cascade is a well-established oncogenic driver in various cancers, including AML with FLT3 mutations.

### RhoA and Rho Kinase

Recent studies have identified novel protein interactions that support cancer cell proliferation. For instance, one FLT3 mutant was found to activate Rho kinase through the activation of RhoA small GTPase, contributing to myeloproliferative disease development (Leischner et al., 2012).

### GADS

GADS, a Grb2-related adaptor protein, physically associates with FLT3-ITD, enhancing downstream signaling activation. This interaction suggests that adaptor proteins play a significant role in modulating the FLT3 signaling cascade and its oncogenic potential (Leischner et al., 2012).

### Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor J (PTPRJ)

PTPRJ is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that has been shown to influence the formation of protein complexes and cell localization. Mutations in PTPRJ can affect FLT3 signaling by altering the phosphorylation status of key signaling molecules (Iuliano et al., 2009).

## Therapeutic Implications and Resistance

The understanding of FLT3 signaling and its associated proteins has significant therapeutic implications. FLT3 inhibitors, such as gilteritinib and midostaurin, have shown efficacy in treating FLT3-mutated AML. However, resistance to these inhibitors often develops, mediated by various mechanisms, including the acquisition of secondary mutations in FLT3 or activation of alternative signaling pathways (Gilliland & Griffin, 2002; Hayakawa et al., 2000).

Combination therapies, such as the use of FLT3 inhibitors with pro-apoptotic agents like venetoclax, have demonstrated synergy and improved outcomes, even in cases of resistance to FLT3 inhibitor monotherapy (Darici et al., 2020). Additionally, the development of novel FLT3 inhibitors that can overcome resistance mutations is an active area of research.

## Conclusion

FLT3 plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of AML through its activation of the PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and STAT5 pathways, which are critical for cell survival and proliferation. The interaction of FLT3 with proteins such as STAT5, RhoA, GADS, and PTPRJ further elucidates the complexity of its signaling network. Understanding these interactions and the mechanisms of drug resistance is crucial for developing effective therapies for AML patients with FLT3 mutations.

## Abstract

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This report delves into the cellular localization of FLT3 and its disease-causing functions, particularly in the context of AML. We explore the mechanisms by which FLT3 mutations contribute to leukemogenesis and the implications for prognosis and treatment. The report synthesizes information from recent studies and clinical trials to provide a comprehensive understanding of FLT3's role in AML.

## Introduction

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematologic malignancy characterized by the clonal expansion of myeloid precursors with a block in differentiation and an increase in proliferation (Kiyoi et al., 2020). Among the genetic aberrations that contribute to AML pathogenesis, mutations in the FLT3 gene are the most common, occurring in approximately 30% of AML cases (Rosnet et al., 1996; Timothy & Ley, 2013; Welch et al., 2012). FLT3 mutations are significant not only for their prevalence but also for their impact on the prognosis and treatment of AML patients.

## FLT3 Localization and Function

FLT3 is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is primarily expressed on the surface of hematopoietic progenitor cells (Turner et al., 1996). It is involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of these cells (Rogers et al., 1994). The FLT3 protein comprises an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane (JM) domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) (Ashihara et al., 1998). The extracellular domain is responsible for ligand binding, which leads to receptor dimerization and activation of the intracellular kinase domain (Weiss & Schlessinger, 1998).

Upon binding to its ligand, FLT3 ligand (FLT3L), FLT3 undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation, which activates downstream signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and RAS pathways (Dosil et al., 1993; Rottapel et al., 1994). These pathways are crucial for the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (Lyman et al., 1995; Ashihara et al., 1998).

## FLT3 in AML Pathogenesis

In AML, FLT3 mutations are predominantly of two types: internal tandem duplication mutations (FLT3-ITD) and point mutations or deletions in the TKD (FLT3-TKD) (Nakao et al., 1996; Yamamoto et al., 2001; Abu-Duhier et al., 2001). FLT3-ITD mutations result in the constitutive activation of the receptor, independent of FLT3L binding, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival (Lyman et al., 1995). FLT3-TKD mutations also lead to constitutive activation of the receptor, although their prognostic impact is less consistent compared to FLT3-ITD mutations (Yamamoto et al., 2001; Abu-Duhier et al., 2001).

The FLT3-ITD mutation is particularly notorious for its association with a poor prognosis in AML, including higher relapse rates and shorter overall survival (OS) (Kiyoi et al., 2020). This mutation leads to the activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways, mainly STAT5, MAPK, and AKT signals, which contribute to the aggressive nature of the disease (Kiyoi et al., 2020).

## Therapeutic Targeting of FLT3

Given the significant role of FLT3 in AML, it has become a prime target for therapeutic intervention. Several FLT3 inhibitors have been developed and approved for clinical use, such as midostaurin and gilteritinib (Kiyoi et al., 2020). These inhibitors have shown efficacy in improving response rates and overall survival in patients with FLT3 mutations. However, resistance to FLT3 inhibitors remains a challenge, with patients often relapsing with more aggressive and drug-resistant disease (Kiyoi et al., 2020).

## Conclusion

FLT3 exerts its most disease-causing function on the cell surface of hematopoietic progenitor cells, where it is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In AML, FLT3 mutations lead to the constitutive activation of the receptor, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation and a poor prognosis. The development of FLT3 inhibitors has provided a new avenue for the treatment of AML, although resistance to these drugs poses a significant challenge. Ongoing research is focused on understanding the mechanisms of resistance and developing strategies to overcome them.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the rapid proliferation of abnormal myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood, leading to impaired hematopoiesis and increased risk of mortality. Among the genetic aberrations associated with AML, mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are some of the most prevalent and clinically significant. This report delves into the mechanistic details of how FLT3 contributes to the pathogenesis of AML, focusing on the functional activity of FLT3 mutations and their increased expression in leukemic cells.

## FLT3 Structure and Function in Hematopoiesis

FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) encoded by the FLT3 gene located on chromosome 13q12. It is expressed on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and plays a crucial role in the regulation of survival, proliferation, and differentiation of these cells. The FLT3 receptor dimerizes and autophosphorylates upon binding its ligand (FLT3L), activating downstream signaling pathways that are essential for normal hematopoietic processes. Notably, FLT3 expression is typically downregulated during hematopoietic differentiation (PMC5600895).

## FLT3 Mutations and Their Impact on AML

In AML, FLT3 is mutated in approximately 30% of patients, with two main types of mutations identified: internal tandem duplications (ITD) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). FLT3-ITD mutations are found in about 25% of AML patients, while TKD mutations occur in approximately 5%. Both mutation types are activating, leading to ligand-independent signaling that promotes cytokine-independent survival and proliferation of AML cells. This constitutive activation of FLT3 signaling is a key driver of leukemogenesis (PMC5600895).

## FLT3-ITD vs. FLT3-TKD: Differential Impact on AML

The FLT3-ITD mutations are particularly aggressive, associated with a higher disease burden, leukocytosis, and a worse prognosis compared to TKD mutations. FLT3-ITD mutations lead to hyperphosphorylation of the receptor and activation of downstream effectors such as STAT5, AKT, and ERK, which are critical for cell survival and proliferation. In contrast, FLT3-TKD mutations, while still activating, do not typically result in leukocytosis and have a less pronounced negative impact on treatment outcomes. This difference in downstream signaling may account for the distinct clinical behaviors observed between the two mutation types (PMC5600895).

## FLT3 Overexpression and Its Role in Disease Progression

In addition to mutations, FLT3 overexpression is a recurrent event in various acute leukemia subtypes and is important for defining the prognostic risk for many patients. The molecular mechanisms leading to FLT3 overexpression are not fully understood, but it is clear that higher FLT3 expression may confer a growth advantage to AML blast cells carrying activating mutations. This suggests that both the increased presence of FLT3 and its constitutive activation contribute to the pathophysiology of AML (AACRJournals.org).

## Therapeutic Targeting of FLT3 in AML

Given the central role of FLT3 in AML pathogenesis, it has emerged as an important therapeutic target. FLT3 inhibitors, such as midostaurin and gilteritinib, have been developed and approved for use in AML patients with FLT3 mutations. These inhibitors are classified based on their specificity for FLT3 and their mechanism of interaction with the receptor. The use of FLT3 inhibitors has shown clinical benefits, including improved survival rates, particularly when used in combination with other treatments like chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents (Nature.com; PMC5600895).

## Resistance to FLT3 Inhibitors

Despite the initial success of FLT3 inhibitors, their efficacy is often limited by the development of resistance. Resistance mechanisms include the protective bone marrow microenvironment, which hinders the eradication of FLT3-mutated leukemic cells, and the emergence of secondary FLT3 mutations or activating mutations in downstream signaling pathways. These resistance mechanisms underscore the complexity of FLT3's role in AML and the need for novel therapeutic strategies (PubMed.gov).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, FLT3 mutations and overexpression play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AML by driving constitutive activation of signaling pathways that promote leukemic cell survival and proliferation. The specific functional activity of FLT3 mutations, particularly FLT3-ITD, is a major factor in disease progression and treatment resistance. However, the increased presence of FLT3 also appears to contribute to the aggressive nature of the disease. Targeted therapies against FLT3 have improved clinical outcomes, but ongoing research is essential to overcome resistance and further enhance treatment efficacy.

These include the PHS 2023-2 Omnibus Solicitation for Small Business Technology Transfer Grant Applications (PA-23-232, PA-23-233), Small Business Innovation Research Grant Applications (PA-23-230, PA-23-231), and the NINDS Exploratory Clinical Trials for Small Business (PAR-21-267, PAR-21-266). Additionally, the Blueprint Medtech: Small Business Translator (PAR-21-282) could also be relevant for technology development related to FLT3 research (NIH, 2023).

For funding consideration under these opportunities, applicants must include the identifier NOT-EB-23-005 in their application, which pertains to early-stage clinical trials that inform early-stage technology development. This suggests that research proposals focusing on FLT3 as a target for early-stage clinical trials could be submitted under these funding opportunities (NIH, 2023).

## Principal Investigators and Their Associations with Biotech or Pharmaceutical Companies

Identifying the PIs for NIH grant applications specifically related to FLT3 requires access to the NIH's internal databases, which is beyond the scope of this report. However, we can infer potential PI involvement in FLT3 research through publications and known FLT3 inhibitors.

A review of clinical trials and publications revealed that 25 unique pharmaceutical or biological agents were identified as FLT3 inhibitors or investigational agents targeting FLT3. Thirty different pharmaceutical companies were collaborators or sole sponsors of these studies. Notably, Novartis and Arog were prominent sponsors, associated with midostaurin and crenolanib, respectively (NIH, 2023).

One identified PI with a disclosed association with pharmaceutical companies is Uma Borate, who is a consultant for Genentech, Novartis, and Jazz Pharmaceuticals. Borate's involvement in FLT3 research is corroborated by a conflict-of-interest disclosure in a publication related to FLT3-mutant AML (NIH, 2023).

## The Landscape of FLT3 Research Funding and Industry Collaboration

The NIH's funding strategy for FY 2023 indicates a commitment to supporting a broad range of meritorious research grant applications, with special consideration for early career investigators. This could potentially influence the number of new PIs entering the field of FLT3 research (NIH, 2023).

The pharmaceutical industry plays a significant role in sponsoring FLT3 research, with a ratio of pharmaceutical to nonprofit/cooperative group involvement of 2.3:1. This suggests a robust level of industry interest and investment in the development of FLT3-targeted therapies. The involvement of pharmaceutical companies in sponsoring clinical trials and research on FLT3 inhibitors is a critical component of advancing the field (NIH, 2023).

## Challenges and Considerations in FLT3 Research Funding

The competitive nature of NIH funding, with more than $33 billion allocated across various awards in FY 2022, underscores the challenge PIs face in securing and sustaining funding. The concentration of funding among a small percentage of PIs suggests that early-stage and established investigators must navigate a highly competitive landscape to support their research on FLT3 (JAMA Network Open, 2023).

Furthermore, the NIH's emphasis on multidisciplinary efforts and collaboration could influence the structure of grant applications and the roles of PIs in FLT3 research. The NIH encourages the participation of junior, early, and mid-career investigators in team science programs, which could foster collaborative approaches to studying FLT3 (NIH, 2023).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the NIH provides various funding opportunities that could support research on FLT3. While specific grant applications and PIs cannot be identified without access to internal NIH data, the involvement of pharmaceutical companies in FLT3 research is evident. PIs like Uma Borate, with disclosed consultancy roles for companies such as Genentech and Novartis, exemplify the intersection of academic research and industry collaboration in this field.

The NIH's funding strategy and the significant role of pharmaceutical companies in sponsoring FLT3 research highlight the dynamic and competitive environment in which PIs operate. As the landscape of FLT3 research evolves, it will be essential for PIs to navigate the complexities of grant applications, industry collaborations, and the pursuit of innovative treatments for AML and other diseases associated with FLT3 mutations.

## Introduction

FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, when mutated, is implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3 mutations, particularly the internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), are one of the most common genetic aberrations in AML and are associated with a poor prognosis. The development of small molecule therapeutics targeting FLT3 mutations has been a significant focus in the treatment of AML, aiming to improve patient outcomes. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of recent press releases from biotech and pharmaceutical companies regarding FLT3-related developments, with a particular emphasis on the creation or progress of small molecule therapeutics.

## Overview of FLT3 and Its Significance in AML

FLT3 mutations occur in approximately 25-30% of all AML cases (Daiichi Sankyo, 2023). These mutations are associated with an aggressive disease course, increased risk of relapse, and shorter overall survival. The five-year survival rate for patients with FLT3-ITD AML has been reported at approximately 20% (Business Wire, 2023). Given these statistics, the development of FLT3 inhibitors is critical for improving the prognosis of patients with this mutation.

## Recent Press Releases on FLT3 Inhibitors

### VANFLYTA® (Quizartinib) by Daiichi Sankyo

Daiichi Sankyo has made significant strides with its FLT3 inhibitor, VANFLYTA® (quizartinib). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved VANFLYTA® for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD positive AML. This approval is specific for use in combination with standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction and cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy, followed by maintenance monotherapy (Business Wire, 2023). VANFLYTA® is the first FLT3 inhibitor approved in the U.S. specifically for this patient population and across the three phases of treatment – induction, consolidation, and maintenance – for newly diagnosed AML (Business Wire, 2023).

Furthermore, VANFLYTA® has also been approved in the European Union (EU) for the same indication, marking it as the first FLT3 inhibitor approved in the EU specifically for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD positive AML (Daiichi Sankyo, 2023; Yahoo Finance, 2023). The approval was based on the results from the QuANTUM-First trial, which demonstrated that VANFLYTA® added to chemotherapy improved overall survival (Daiichi Sankyo, 2023).

### PHI-101 by Unknown Company

Another development in the FLT3 inhibitor landscape is PHI-101, a potent small molecule Type I FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). PHI-101 is designed to overcome resistance in AML and selectively inhibits both FLT3-ITD mutations and a variety of FLT3 point mutations in preclinical AML models. PHI-101 has shown increased anti-leukemic activity compared to gilteritinib in both in vitro and in vivo studies with AML patient-derived primary leukemic cells. Phase 1 global clinical trials for PHI-101 against refractory and relapsed (R/R) AML are currently ongoing to assess overall safety and efficacy (Blood, 2022).

### Other FLT3 Inhibitors

The landscape of FLT3 inhibitors has seen other significant developments. Midostaurin was the first FLT3 inhibitor approved by the FDA in 2017, followed by gilteritinib in 2018. Quizartinib received approval in Japan in 2019 (RSC Medicinal Chemistry, 2022). These approvals have set the stage for the development of newer FLT3 inhibitors like VANFLYTA® and PHI-101.

## Clinical Impact and Future Directions

The approval of VANFLYTA® represents a significant advancement in the treatment of FLT3-ITD positive AML. The drug's efficacy in improving overall survival when added to standard chemotherapy makes it a valuable treatment option for this aggressive and historically difficult-to-treat subtype of AML (Yahoo Finance, 2023). The development of FLT3 inhibitors like VANFLYTA® and PHI-101 is crucial in creating new standards of care for patients with cancer, reflecting a commitment to innovation in oncology (Daiichi Sankyo, 2023).

The clinical trial agenda for FLT3-mutant AML requires high percentage enrollment for sustainability, indicating a robust and ongoing effort in the research and development of FLT3-targeted therapies (ScienceDirect, 2020). The concurrent approval of companion diagnostic tests to detect FLT3-ITD mutations in patients with newly diagnosed AML underscores the importance of precision medicine in this field (Business Wire, 2023).

## Conclusion

The recent press releases from biotech and pharmaceutical companies highlight significant progress in the development of small molecule therapeutics targeting FLT3 mutations in AML. The approval of VANFLYTA® in the U.S. and EU specifically for newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD positive AML patients and the ongoing clinical trials for PHI-101 represent important steps forward in the treatment of this challenging disease. These developments not only offer new hope for patients but also demonstrate the industry's commitment to addressing unmet medical needs through innovative research.

## Introduction

The Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene is a critical focus in the study of hematopoietic and leukemic stem cell biology. Mutations in FLT3, particularly internal tandem duplications (ITDs), are associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are a target for therapeutic intervention. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology has revolutionized the field of genetic research, providing a powerful tool for modifying genes in various organisms and cell types. This report delves into the current state of CRISPR/Cas9 and knockout (KO) studies related to FLT3, highlighting their relevance in profiling FLT3 in model systems to test and screen how modulating FLT3 could improve or rectify disease outcomes.

## CRISPR/Cas9 and FLT3 in Disease Models

CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been employed to create precise genetic modifications, including the generation of FLT3 mutations in cellular and animal models. This has enabled researchers to study the functional consequences of FLT3 mutations and to screen for potential therapeutic interventions. For instance, CRISPR-directed mutagenesis (CDM) has been used to reconstruct genetic profiles within the FLT3 gene of AML patients, allowing for the recapitulation of patient-specific mutations in cell lines. This approach facilitates the analysis of how these mutations influence cellular transformation and drug sensitivity or resistance (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI], 2023).

## FLT3 Modulation and Therapeutic Strategies

The modulation of FLT3 through CRISPR/Cas9 has significant therapeutic implications. Studies have shown that FLT3 inhibitors can serve as minimal residual disease (MRD)-guided salvage treatment for molecular failure in FLT3-mutated AML. The use of FLT3 inhibitors, guided by high-sensitivity next-generation sequencing (NGS) for FLT3-ITD at molecular failure, has been suggested to improve outcomes and potentially bridge patients to allogeneic transplant (Nature, 2023). This highlights the importance of FLT3 modulation in the context of personalized medicine and targeted therapy.

## CRISPR/Cas9 in Clinical Trials and Drug Resistance

Clinical trials involving CRISPR/Cas9 are underway for various diseases, including cancer. For example, trials are exploring the use of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) edited via CRISPR/Cas9 for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic gastrointestinal cancers (Frontiers in Medicine, 2023). Additionally, CRISPR detection methods have been developed for the diagnosis of drug-resistant FLT3 mutations, such as FLT3-F691L, which play a crucial role in early screening and therapy options in AML treatment (NCBI, 2023).

## CRISPR/Cas9 in Disease Correction and Biomarker Identification

CRISPR/Cas9 has shown great potential in generating disease models and correcting monogenic disease mutations. The technology has been used to correct mutations in the CFTR gene responsible for cystic fibrosis, demonstrating the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9 in disease correction (NCBI, 2023). Furthermore, predictive biomarkers for FLT3 inhibitors in clinical trials have been identified, aiding in the classification of patients into responders and non-responders. This is crucial for the administration of drugs and the development of companion diagnostics (NCBI, 2023).

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the promising applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in modulating FLT3, challenges remain. Off-target effects and the need for efficient delivery systems are areas that require further optimization. Moreover, the development of novel CRISPR systems and the discovery of additional biomarkers for FLT3 mutations will be essential for advancing therapeutic strategies.

## Conclusion

CRISPR/Cas9 technology has opened new avenues for understanding and treating diseases associated with FLT3 mutations. The ability to model FLT3 mutations in vitro and in vivo has provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression and has facilitated the development of targeted therapies. As CRISPR/Cas9 continues to evolve, its application in clinical settings holds the promise of improving disease outcomes through personalized and precision medicine.

## Introduction

FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the normal development of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. Aberrations in FLT3, such as internal tandem duplications (ITDs) and point mutations like D835Y, are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor prognosis. Consequently, FLT3 has become a significant target for therapeutic interventions in AML. This report delves into the specific cell lines used to profile FLT3 activity, the tissues associated with these cell lines, and the disease indications for which these cell lines were harvested.

## Cell Lines Used to Profile FLT3 Activity

### MV4-11 and MOLM-13

The MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cell lines are derived from patients with AML and harbor FLT3 mutations. MV4-11 is characterized by the presence of FLT3-ITD, a mutation that confers constitutive activation of the FLT3 kinase and contributes to leukemogenesis. MOLM-13 also carries the FLT3-ITD mutation and is frequently used in preclinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors (Carson et al., 2013).

### PL-21, IVS-0059, and IVS-0062

PL-21, IVS-0059, and IVS-0062 are additional AML cell lines that contain FLT3 mutations. These cell lines have been subjected to deep sequencing to identify FLT3 mutations, including ITDs of varying sizes. The identification and characterization of FLT3 variants in these cell lines are crucial for developing and testing targeted therapies (Carson et al., 2013).

### NALM-6

NALM-6 is a FLT3 wild-type cell line derived from a patient with B cell precursor leukemia. It serves as a control in studies investigating FLT3 mutations. The absence of FLT3 mutations in NALM-6 allows researchers to discern the specific effects of FLT3 aberrations in other cell lines (Carson et al., 2013).

### BV173

The BV173 cell line originates from a patient with B cell precursor leukemia and has been genetically modified to express the FLT3D835Y mutation. This mutation is not naturally occurring in commercially available leukemic cell lines, necessitating the introduction of the mutation into cell lines like BV173 for research purposes. The modified BV173 cell line, referred to as BV173D835Y, has been used in xenograft mouse models to demonstrate the efficacy of TCRFLT3D/Y cells in targeting FLT3D835Y leukemic cells in vivo (Nature, 2023).

### ML-2 and RS4;11

ML-2 and RS4;11 are additional cell lines transduced to express the FLT3D/Y minigene. These cell lines, along with BV173 and NALM-6, have been used to study the antigen presentation of FLT3 peptides on HLA and the cytotoxicity of TCRFLT3D/Y cells against FLT3D/Y-expressing cells (Nature, 2023).

## Tissues Associated with Cell Lines

The cell lines mentioned above are primarily derived from hematopoietic tissues, specifically from patients with various forms of leukemia:

- **MV4-11 and MOLM-13**: Derived from the blood or bone marrow of AML patients.
- **PL-21, IVS-0059, and IVS-0062**: Also derived from AML patients, representing the myeloid lineage of hematopoietic cells.
- **NALM-6**: Originating from a patient with B cell precursor leukemia, representing the lymphoid lineage.
- **BV173**: Derived from a patient with B cell precursor leukemia, indicating its origin from the lymphoid lineage.
- **ML-2 and RS4;11**: Associated with myeloid leukemia, with RS4;11 specifically being derived from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

## Disease Indications and Patient Origins

The cell lines used for FLT3 profiling are harvested from patients diagnosed with various forms of leukemia, a group of malignancies affecting the blood and bone marrow:

- **AML**: A heterogeneous disease characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature myeloid cells. FLT3 mutations, particularly FLT3-ITD and FLT3-D835Y, are significant prognostic factors in AML and are associated with a high relapse rate and poor overall survival.
- **B cell precursor leukemia**: A type of ALL characterized by the proliferation of B cell precursors. While FLT3 is not commonly mutated in B cell precursor leukemia, the NALM-6 cell line serves as a valuable control in FLT3 research.

## Conclusion

The cell lines MV4-11, MOLM-13, PL-21, IVS-0059, IVS-0062, NALM-6, BV173, ML-2, and RS4;11 are instrumental in advancing our understanding of FLT3's role in leukemia and in the development of targeted therapies. These cell lines, derived from patients with AML and B cell precursor leukemia, provide critical insights into the pathophysiology of these diseases and the therapeutic potential of FLT3 inhibitors. The ongoing research using these cell lines continues to contribute to the development of novel treatments aimed at improving outcomes for patients with FLT3-mutated AML.

## Introduction

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mutations in the FLT3 gene are among the most common genetic alterations in AML, with significant implications for disease prognosis and treatment strategies. This report delves into the specific mutational variants of FLT3, their disease-causing potential, and the epidemiology of these mutations in the AML patient population.

## FLT3 Mutational Variants

FLT3 mutations in AML are predominantly of two types: internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD). FLT3-ITD mutations are characterized by the duplication of a variable number of base pairs in the juxtamembrane domain, leading to constitutive activation of the FLT3 kinase. FLT3-TKD mutations, on the other hand, involve substitutions, typically in the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain, which also result in constitutive kinase activity.

### FLT3-ITD Mutations

FLT3-ITD mutations are strongly associated with leukocytosis and an increased percentage of blast cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of AML patients. These mutations are independent poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and event-free survival (EFS) in AML patients, excluding those with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The presence of FLT3-ITD mutations is particularly associated with a variant morphology of APL and the presence of the short breakpoint cluster region 3 PML-RARA isoforms. FLT3-ITD mutations have been consistently shown to be associated with a more aggressive phenotype and worse survival in AML. A higher allelic ratio of FLT3-ITD is associated with inferior outcomes, especially when frontline FLT3 inhibitors are not used.

### FLT3-TKD Mutations

FLT3-TKD mutations are less well-defined in their prognostic impact compared to FLT3-ITD mutations. While some studies have indicated adverse effects of FLT3-TKD mutations on long-term outcomes, others have shown no or only minimal prognostic impact. FLT3-TKD mutations are frequently found in AML with CBFB-MYH11 but are infrequent in core-binding factor AML (CBF-AML) consisting of AML with RUNX1-RUNX1T1.

## Disease Causation and Prognostic Impact

FLT3 mutations are mainly found in myeloid neoplasms such as AML and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In AML, FLT3-ITD mutations are associated with poor prognosis, while the clinical significance of FLT3-TKD mutations is less consistent. FLT3 mutations are infrequent in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), with FLT3-TKD being recurrently found in patients with a KMT2A gene rearrangement or hyperdiploidy.

The prognostic impact of FLT3 mutations has been extensively studied, with FLT3-ITD mutations being associated with an increased risk of relapse and shorter OS compared to patients without the mutation. FLT3-TKD mutations have not been consistently associated with clinical outcomes.

## Epidemiology of FLT3 Mutations

FLT3 mutations are the most frequently identified genetic alterations in AML patients. FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD occur in approximately 20% and 10% of AML cases, respectively. The frequency of FLT3 mutations varies with age, with FLT3-ITD found in about 25% of adult patients and more than 30% of patients over 55 years of age. In contrast, FLT3-ITD is found in only about 10% of pediatric patients and in less than 5% of infant AML patients under 1 year of age.

FLT3 mutations are frequently found in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) but are infrequent in AML with altered karyotypes. However, AML with DEK-NUP214 and PML-RARA frequently harbors FLT3 mutations.

## Treatment Implications and Future Directions

The discovery of FLT3 mutations has led to the development and approval of FLT3 inhibitors for clinical use, changing the therapeutic paradigms for AML with FLT3 mutations. The use of targeted therapy with midostaurin, in combination with chemotherapy (CT), has shown a positive change in the prognosis of FLT3mut patients. Further research is needed to understand the impact of FLT3 mutations in the absence of NPM1 mutation and to evaluate the efficacy of other FLT3 inhibitors.

## Conclusion

FLT3 mutations, particularly FLT3-ITD, are significant disease-causing mutations in AML, associated with a poor prognosis. The development of FLT3 inhibitors has improved survival outcomes, especially when used in combination with CT. The frequency of FLT3 mutations in AML underscores the importance of genetic testing in the management of the disease. As the understanding of FLT3 mutations continues to evolve, so too will the strategies for targeting these mutations in AML treatment.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating hematological malignancy characterized by the rapid proliferation of abnormal myeloid precursor cells in the bone marrow and blood. The discovery of recurrent genetic mutations in AML has revolutionized the understanding of the disease's pathogenesis and has led to the development of targeted therapies. Among these mutations, internal tandem duplications (ITDs) and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are particularly significant due to their high prevalence and association with poor prognosis (Weisberg et al., 2015; Scholl et al., 2020). The identification of 'druggable' mutational variants, akin to the G12C mutation in KRAS, is a critical area of research in the development of small molecule inhibitors for AML.

## FLT3 Mutations and Their Significance in AML

FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Mutations in FLT3, such as ITDs and point mutations in the TKD, result in constitutive activation of the FLT3 signaling pathway, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival, which are hallmarks of AML (Weisberg et al., 2015; Scholl et al., 2020). The FLT3-ITD mutation is particularly notorious for its association with a high relapse rate and poor overall survival (Weisberg et al., 2015).

## Targeting FLT3 Mutations: The Development of Small Molecule Inhibitors

The recognition of FLT3 as a therapeutic target has led to the development of small molecule inhibitors designed to block the ATP-binding site of the FLT3 kinase domain, thereby inhibiting its activity. These inhibitors are categorized into two types: Type I inhibitors, which bind to both the active and inactive conformations of FLT3, and Type II inhibitors, which bind to the inactive conformation (Weisberg et al., 2015). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Type I inhibitors midostaurin and gilteritinib for the treatment of FLT3-mutated AML (Weisberg et al., 2015).

## Druggable Mutational Variants of FLT3

The search for 'druggable' mutational variants in FLT3 is driven by the need to overcome resistance to existing FLT3 inhibitors. Resistance often arises due to secondary mutations in the FLT3 gene that prevent inhibitor binding or activate alternative signaling pathways (Weisberg et al., 2015; Scholl et al., 2020). A notable example of a 'druggable' mutation is the F691L mutation in the FLT3 kinase domain. This mutation creates a novel hydrophobic pocket that confers resistance to certain FLT3 inhibitors, such as quizartinib, by altering the drug-binding dynamics (Weisberg et al., 2015). However, other inhibitors, such as PLX3397, do not show a significant difference in dissociation from the FLT3-F691L mutant compared to the wild-type FLT3, suggesting that this novel pocket could be targeted by specific small molecules (Weisberg et al., 2015).

Another critical mutation is the D835Y mutation within the activation loop of the FLT3 kinase domain. This mutation has been associated with resistance to both first- and second-generation FLT3 inhibitors (Weisberg et al., 2015). The D835Y mutation alters the conformation of the activation loop, potentially creating a new 'druggable' site. The development of T cell receptor (TCR) therapies targeting specific recurrent point mutations, such as FLT3D835Y, provides a potential means for the highly efficacious eradication of specific tumor clones (Giannakopoulou et al., 2023).

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the approval of FLT3 inhibitors, the clinical duration of response is often short-lived, with patients relapsing with more aggressive and drug-resistant disease (Weisberg et al., 2015). The exact mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors remain elusive, with receptor- and nonreceptor-related mutations, epigenetic changes, and signaling pathway alterations all potentially playing a role (Weisberg et al., 2015). It is crucial to identify and preemptively target these alterations early at the minimal residual disease (MRD) stage to prevent relapse and improve survival (Weisberg et al., 2015).

Combination therapies, such as the use of FLT3 inhibitors with venetoclax, have shown promise in pre-clinical models and early clinical trials, even in samples with resistance to FLT3 inhibitor monotherapy (Weisberg et al., 2015). These combinations aim to increase the cytotoxic activity and overcome resistance mechanisms.

## Conclusion

The identification of 'druggable' mutational variants in FLT3, such as the F691L and D835Y mutations, represents a significant step forward in the development of targeted therapies for AML. These novel pockets provide opportunities for the design of small molecule inhibitors that can overcome resistance to current FLT3 inhibitors. However, the complexity of resistance mechanisms necessitates a continued effort to understand these pathways and develop combination therapies that can provide durable remissions for patients with FLT3-mutated AML.

## Introduction

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. In a healthy state, FLT3 signaling is crucial for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. However, in a diseased state, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutations in the FLT3 gene can lead to aberrant signaling pathways that contribute to leukemogenesis. This report delves into the interactions of FLT3 with other proteins and biological molecules in both normal and diseased states, highlighting the significance of these interactions in the pathophysiology of AML.

## FLT3 in Normal Hematopoiesis

In the normal physiological context, FLT3 is expressed on the surface of a subset of hematopoietic stem cells, as well as differentiated cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells (ScienceDirect, 2022). The binding of FLT3 ligand (FLT3L) to the receptor induces dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation of the receptor, which activates downstream signaling pathways including PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and STAT5 (Nature, 2022). These pathways are essential for the expansion and development of various blood cell lineages.

### Key Interacting Proteins and Molecules in Normal State:

- **FLT3 Ligand (FLT3L):** FLT3L is the primary ligand for FLT3 and is responsible for the activation of the receptor through ligand-induced dimerization (Nature, 2022).
- **PI3K/Akt Pathway:** This pathway is activated upon FLT3 signaling and is involved in cell survival and proliferation (Nature, 2022).
- **MAPK Pathway:** Another critical pathway activated by FLT3, the MAPK pathway, is involved in cell differentiation (Nature, 2022).
- **STAT5:** Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is a transcription factor that is activated downstream of FLT3 signaling and plays a role in cell survival and proliferation (Nature, 2022).

## FLT3 in Disease: Acute Myeloid Leukemia

In AML, FLT3 is one of the most frequently mutated genes, with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations being the most common types. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of FLT3, independent of FLT3L binding, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation and a block in differentiation, which are hallmarks of AML (Nature, 2022; PubMed, 2022).

### Key Interacting Proteins and Molecules in Diseased State:

- **SET Protein:** SET is a protein that interacts with FLT3 and is involved in the regulation of its membrane localization. In FLT3-ITD mutated cells, the interaction between SET and FLT3 is disrupted, which impairs membrane translocation of FLT3 (PubMed, 2022).
- **HuR Protein:** HuR is an RNA-binding protein that interacts with the 3'UTR of FLT3 mRNA and is involved in the regulation of FLT3 expression. This interaction is mediated by SET and is disrupted in FLT3-ITD mutated cells (PubMed, 2022).
- **PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway:** Mutated FLT3 activates this pathway, leading to increased cell survival and proliferation (PubMed, 2022).
- **STAT5 and Pim-1:** FLT3-ITD mutations specifically activate STAT5 and Pim-1, contributing to the proliferative advantage of FLT3-ITD mutated AML cells (PubMed, 2022).
- **Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs):** HSP90beta1 and GRP94 are chaperone proteins upregulated in response to FLT3-ITD localization in the endoplasmic reticulum, contributing to leukemogenesis (PubMed, 2022).

## Therapeutic Targeting of FLT3 in AML

Given the critical role of FLT3 in AML pathogenesis, FLT3 has become an established target for therapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as midostaurin have been approved for the treatment of FLT3-mutated AML, demonstrating the importance of FLT3 signaling in the disease (ScienceDirect, 2022). These inhibitors aim to block the aberrant signaling induced by FLT3 mutations, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells.

### FLT3 Inhibitors and Their Interactions:

- **Midostaurin:** A multi-targeted TKI that inhibits FLT3 signaling in FLT3-mutated AML (ScienceDirect, 2022).
- **Quizartinib:** A potent FLT3 inhibitor that has shown a survival benefit in clinical trials for patients with FLT3-mutated AML (Nature, 2023).
- **Venetoclax:** While not a direct FLT3 inhibitor, venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor that has been used in combination with FLT3 inhibitors to target AML cells (Nature, 2023).

## Conclusion

FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a dual role in hematopoiesis, supporting normal blood cell development and contributing to leukemogenesis when mutated. The interactions of FLT3 with various proteins and signaling pathways underscore its importance in both health and disease. In the context of AML, FLT3 mutations lead to constitutive activation of the receptor and downstream signaling pathways, promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival. Targeting FLT3 with specific inhibitors has become a cornerstone of AML therapy, offering hope for improved outcomes in patients with this aggressive leukemia.

## Introduction

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hematopoiesis, particularly in the proliferation and survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Mutations in FLT3, such as internal tandem duplications (ITD) and point mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor prognosis due to high relapse rates and drug resistance (Jhoonline.biomedcentral.com, 2021; Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, 2023). The identification of small molecule ligands that can modulate FLT3 activity is of significant therapeutic interest, particularly in overcoming resistance to existing FLT3 inhibitors.

## Interaction of Small Molecule Ligands with FLT3

### KX2-391 as a Candidate FLT3 Inhibitor

Recent studies have identified KX2-391 as a potential FLT3 inhibitor through molecular docking simulations. KX2-391, initially reported as an SRC/tubulin dual inhibitor with anticancer activities, was computationally screened against 1487 small molecule ligands from the L3400 Clinical Compound Library. The simulations predicted the interaction of KX2-391 with FLT3 at residues L616, V624, and E661 (Jhoonline.biomedcentral.com, 2021). These interactions were further confirmed by cellular thermal shift assays, which demonstrated an increase in the thermal stability of FLT3 protein in the presence of KX2-391, indicating a direct interaction between the ligand and the protein. Additionally, KX2-391 was found to potently inhibit the growth of FLT3-ITD-expressing Ba/F3 cells, including those with FLT3-ITD-TKD mutations (Jhoonline.biomedcentral.com, 2021).

### Binding Site Analysis and Resistance Mutations

The binding site of KX2-391 on FLT3 does not include the residue Phe691, which is noteworthy as mutations in the gatekeeper residue, such as F691L, induce lower binding affinity to FLT3 inhibitors and contribute to resistance (Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, 2023). This suggests that KX2-391 may offer a therapeutic advantage by potentially overcoming resistance associated with the F691L mutation.

### Other Small Molecules Inducing FLT3 Degradation

In addition to direct kinase inhibition, small molecules that induce FLT3 degradation represent another strategy to modulate FLT3 activity. Compounds such as 17-AAG (an Hsp90 inhibitor), EGCG, EGC, ECG, and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been identified as inducers of FLT3 degradation (Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, 2023). These molecules may act by promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of FLT3, thereby reducing the levels of active kinase and its downstream signaling.

### Resistance Mechanisms and Next-Generation FLT3 Inhibitors

Resistance to FLT3 inhibitors is a significant challenge in the treatment of AML. Resistance can be categorized into on-target effects, such as secondary mutations of the FLT3 gene (e.g., D835Y and F691L), and off-target effects, which involve alterations in downstream signaling pathways, epigenetic regulators, and myeloid transcription factors (Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, 2023). The development of next-generation FLT3 inhibitors that can overcome these resistance mechanisms is crucial for improving patient outcomes.

### Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) and Virtual Screening

Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is a powerful tool in the identification of new FLT3 inhibitors. Homology modeling of the DFG-in conformation of FLT3 has enabled the identification of inhibitors that are specific to this conformation, which may be more effective in treating AML. The DFG-in conformation is characterized by the orientation of the Phe group of the DFG motif, which influences the binding of inhibitors. Known FLT3 inhibitors that bind to the DFG-in conformation include SU11248, CEP-701, and PKC-412, while inhibitors such as sorafenib bind to the DFG-out conformation (Nature.com, 2015).

Through SBVS, compounds BPR056 and BPR080 were identified as hits for FLT3 kinase inhibition, with IC50 values of 2.3 μM and 10.7 μM, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory calculations suggest that BPR056 interacts with FLT3 in a stable manner and could be optimized for drug development (Nature.com, 2015).

## Conclusion

The identification of small molecule ligands that interact with FLT3 is a critical step in the development of targeted therapies for AML. KX2-391 has emerged as a promising candidate that may overcome resistance associated with mutations in the gatekeeper residue. The use of SBDD and SBVS has facilitated the discovery of novel chemotypes that can modulate FLT3 activity, either by direct inhibition or by inducing protein degradation. As resistance to FLT3 inhibitors remains a significant challenge, the continued exploration of the molecular interactions between FLT3 and small molecule ligands is essential for the advancement of AML treatment.

## Introduction

FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. It is activated by binding to its ligand, FLT3LG, and is involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. FLT3 is known for its involvement in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where mutations such as internal tandem duplications (ITD) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) can lead to constitutive activation of the receptor and contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Given the importance of FLT3 in AML, understanding its structure, function, and the domains involved in its activity is crucial for the development of targeted therapies.

## FLT3 Structure and Function

FLT3 is composed of an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like folds, a transmembrane helix, a juxtamembrane (JM) domain, and a kinase domain that includes N and C lobes with an activation loop situated between them. The JM domain plays an autoinhibitory role by binding to the N lobe of the kinase domain and stabilizing the activation loop in a closed configuration, keeping the protein in an inactive conformation. Ligand binding induces homodimerization and phosphorylation of the JM domains, leading to a shift that allows the activation loop to adopt an open conformation, revealing the ATP binding site and activating the receptor. FLT3 signaling activates downstream pathways such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and STAT5, which are involved in various cellular processes.

## FLT3 Mutations and Their Effects

Mutations in FLT3, particularly ITD mutations occurring in exon 11 and point mutations in exon 17, disrupt the autoinhibitory interaction between the JM domain and the N lobe, leading to constitutive activation of the receptor. These mutations are significant in AML, with ITD mutations present in approximately one-third of patients. The FLT3-ITD mutations result in a longer JM domain, while TKD mutations alter the amino acid sequence in the activation loop, keeping the protein in an active conformation.

## DNA Binding Domains in FLT3

The primary function of FLT3 does not involve direct binding to DNA; instead, it is a membrane-bound receptor that transduces extracellular signals into the cell to activate downstream signaling pathways that can ultimately affect gene expression. Therefore, FLT3 itself is not known to have DNA binding domains or specific residues that directly interact with DNA or other nucleic acids. Instead, its role in gene expression is indirect, through the activation of signaling cascades that lead to the activation or repression of gene transcription.

## FLT3 and Gene Expression

Although FLT3 does not bind DNA directly, its activation has profound effects on gene expression. The downstream signaling pathways activated by FLT3, such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and STAT5, lead to the phosphorylation and activation of various transcription factors. These transcription factors then translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to DNA and regulate the transcription of genes involved in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation.

## Therapeutic Targeting of FLT3

Given the lack of direct DNA binding by FLT3, therapeutic strategies have focused on inhibiting its kinase activity to prevent the aberrant signaling associated with its mutations in AML. FLT3 inhibitors are classified into two types: Type 1 inhibitors, which bind to the ATP binding pocket and are not conformation-dependent, and Type 2 inhibitors, which stabilize FLT3 in the inactive conformation. However, resistance to these inhibitors can occur through various mechanisms, including secondary mutations in FLT3, alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment, and activation of alternative signaling pathways.

## Conclusion

In summary, FLT3 is a critical receptor tyrosine kinase involved in hematopoiesis and the pathogenesis of AML. While FLT3 does not have known DNA binding domains or specific residues for direct interaction with nucleic acids, its activation leads to downstream signaling events that ultimately influence gene expression. Therapeutic interventions have focused on inhibiting the kinase activity of FLT3 to counteract the effects of activating mutations. Understanding the structure and function of FLT3, as well as the mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, remains essential for the development of effective treatments for AML.

## Introduction

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating hematological malignancy characterized by the rapid proliferation of abnormal myeloid precursor cells in the bone marrow and blood. One of the most significant prognostic factors in AML is the presence of internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene. FLT3 mutations are found in approximately 30% of AML cases and are associated with a poor prognosis (Daver et al., 2019). The development of small molecule ligands, or tool compounds, that modulate the activity of FLT3 has been a focal point in the treatment of FLT3-mutated AML. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the known small molecule ligands targeting FLT3, their use as research tools, and their availability for testing.

## FLT3 and Its Role in AML

FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Mutations in FLT3, particularly FLT3-ITD, result in constitutive activation of the receptor, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, which are hallmarks of AML (Grafone et al., 2012).

## Small Molecule Inhibitors of FLT3

### First-Generation FLT3 Inhibitors

The first-generation FLT3 inhibitors were developed to target the ATP-binding site of the FLT3 kinase domain. These inhibitors, such as midostaurin (Rydapt), were designed to inhibit the kinase activity of FLT3 and demonstrated clinical efficacy in AML patients. Midostaurin received FDA approval in 2017 as the first FLT3 inhibitor for the treatment of AML (Daver et al., 2019).

### Second-Generation FLT3 Inhibitors

Second-generation FLT3 inhibitors, such as gilteritinib (Xospata), were developed to overcome resistance mechanisms that limited the efficacy of first-generation inhibitors. Gilteritinib received FDA approval in 2018 and has shown potent inhibitory activity against FLT3-ITD and significant selectivity against AML cells expressing FLT3-ITD (Zhang et al., 2023).

### Emerging FLT3 Inhibitors

Recent research has focused on the discovery of novel FLT3 inhibitors with improved selectivity and efficacy. For instance, a series of new compounds with a pyrazole amine scaffold demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against FLT3-ITD and significant selectivity against both FLT3-ITD and AML cells expressing FLT3-ITD. One such compound, referred to as compound 46, showed promising cellular activity and was metabolically stable in vitro, suppressing tumor growth significantly in an MV4-11 xenograft model in vivo (Ke et al., 2015).

## Challenges and Perspectives in FLT3 Inhibitor Therapy

Despite the clinical success of FLT3 inhibitors, several challenges remain. The development of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors is a significant hurdle, often mediated by secondary mutations within the FLT3 gene or activation of alternative signaling pathways (McMahon et al., 2019). Additionally, the bone marrow microenvironment may contribute to resistance by providing survival signals to leukemia cells (Ghiaur & Levis, 2017).

## Availability of FLT3 Inhibitors for Research and Testing

FLT3 inhibitors are not only used in clinical settings but also serve as valuable tool compounds for research purposes. They are broadly accessible to the market for testing, with pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis International AG, Astellas Pharma Inc., and Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited dominating the current market (Research and Markets, 2023). The availability of these inhibitors has facilitated high-throughput drug screening, leading to the identification of novel potent compounds against AML (NCBI, 2023).

## Conclusion

The development of small molecule ligands targeting FLT3 has significantly advanced the treatment of FLT3-mutated AML. First and second-generation FLT3 inhibitors have been approved for clinical use and have improved the prognosis for many patients. Ongoing research continues to identify novel inhibitors with the potential to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve therapeutic outcomes. The availability of FLT3 inhibitors for research has enabled the scientific community to explore the mechanisms of drug action and develop new therapeutic strategies. As the understanding of FLT3 biology and the interaction with its inhibitors deepens, the potential for more effective treatments for AML patients remains promising.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the rapid proliferation of abnormal myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood, leading to impaired hematopoiesis and increased risk of mortality. Among the genetic aberrations associated with AML, mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are one of the most common and clinically significant. FLT3 mutations are detected in approximately 30% of AML cases and are associated with a poor prognosis due to the aggressive nature of the disease and the development of resistance to conventional therapies (Daver, Venugopal, & Ravandi, 2021). The therapeutic targeting of FLT3, therefore, represents a critical area of research and clinical intervention.

## Post-Translational Modifications of FLT3

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are chemical modifications that occur after protein synthesis, altering protein function, localization, and interactions. In the context of FLT3, PTMs can significantly influence the receptor's activity and its role in leukemogenesis. The two primary forms of FLT3 mutations in AML are internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain mutations (FLT3-TKD). FLT3-ITD mutations are particularly notorious for their association with a high leukemic burden, poor overall survival (OS), and early relapse (Daver, Venugopal, & Ravandi, 2021).

### Glycosylation and FLT3-ITD

Glycosylation, the addition of carbohydrate groups to proteins, is a PTM that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of FLT3-ITD AML. Schmidt-Arras et al. (2023) highlighted the existence of two forms of the FLT3 receptor: a 150 kDa glycosylated mature form and a 130 kDa underglycosylated immature form. The underglycosylated form is predominantly found in cells expressing FLT3-ITD and is associated with altered subcellular localization, which may contribute to drug resistance (Schmidt-Arras et al., 2023). This underglycosylated form of FLT3-ITD is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, rarely reaching the plasma membrane (PM), which affects downstream signaling and the development of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (Schmidt-Arras et al., 2023).

### Phosphorylation and FLT3-ITD

Phosphorylation, the addition of phosphate groups to proteins, is another critical PTM that regulates FLT3 activity. FLT3-ITD mutations lead to constitutive activation of the receptor, independent of ligand binding, resulting in aberrant cell proliferation. The phosphorylation state of FLT3-ITD is a key determinant of its oncogenic potential and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Splice Variants of FLT3

Splice variants of FLT3 also play a role in the pathophysiology of AML. Alternative splicing can generate different isoforms of the FLT3 receptor, which may have distinct functional properties and implications for disease progression and treatment response. The prognostic significance of FLT3-TKD mutations, which are less common than FLT3-ITD mutations, is not as clear. However, both types of mutations lead to constitutive activation of the receptor and downstream signaling pathways, albeit with different impacts on prognosis (Daver, Venugopal, & Ravandi, 2021).

## Therapeutic Strategies Targeting FLT3

### FLT3 Inhibitors

The development of FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3is) has been a significant advancement in the treatment of FLT3-mutated AML. These small-molecule drugs target FLT3 mutations and are categorized as first- and next-generation inhibitors based on their specificity and ability to inhibit FLT3 and associated signaling pathways. First-generation inhibitors, such as midostaurin and sorafenib, have broader kinase targets, while second-generation inhibitors, including gilteritinib and quizartinib, are more specific and potent against FLT3 (Daver, Venugopal, & Ravandi, 2021).

### Resistance to FLT3 Inhibitors

Despite the initial efficacy of FLT3is, resistance remains a significant challenge. Resistance mechanisms can be FLT3-dependent or -independent and may involve additional mutations or alterations in signaling pathways. For example, the acquisition of point mutations in the FLT3 gene, such as D835 or F691L, can confer resistance to type II FLT3is, which bind adjacent to the ATP-binding pocket of the receptor (Daver, Venugopal, & Ravandi, 2021).

### Combination Therapies

To overcome resistance and improve treatment outcomes, combination therapies have been explored. A dual-drug strategy combining FLT3is with proteasome inhibitors has shown efficacy in treating relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD AML by restoring the stability of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is downregulated by FLT3 inhibition (Li et al., 2023). Additionally, the combination of FLT3is with other agents targeting altered molecules in resistant cells is being investigated to abrogate resistance (Daver, Venugopal, & Ravandi, 2021).

## Conclusion

The state of FLT3 that is predicted to be in need of therapeutic intervention in AML is primarily the activated, mutated forms, particularly FLT3-ITD, which are characterized by constitutive kinase activity and altered PTMs, such as underglycosylation. These aberrant forms of FLT3 contribute to the aggressive nature of the disease and the development of drug resistance. Therapeutic strategies targeting FLT3 must consider the complex interplay of PTMs, splice variants, and resistance mechanisms to effectively combat FLT3-mutated AML. Ongoing research and clinical trials are essential to refine these strategies and improve patient outcomes.

## Introduction

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. The significance of FLT3 is underscored by its involvement in various hematological malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where mutations such as internal tandem duplication (ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations lead to constitutive activation of the receptor, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease. Consequently, FLT3 has emerged as a critical target for therapeutic intervention, with antibodies against FLT3 being at the forefront of research and clinical applications. This report delves into the commonly used FLT3 antibodies, their sources, community preferences in research, and documented use cases that underscore their effectiveness and utility.

## FLT3 Antibodies and Their Sources

FLT3 antibodies are indispensable tools in research and clinical diagnostics, serving as the basis for the development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and other targeted therapies. One of the notable FLT3 antibodies is the 20D9-ADC, which has been developed using innovative P5 conjugation technology. This antibody has demonstrated potent cytotoxicity to FLT3-expressing cells, including those with FLT3-ITD mutations, in both in vitro and in vivo settings. The 20D9-ADC has shown significant tumor reduction and even durable complete remission in AML xenograft models, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent (Thermo Fisher Scientific; PubMed).

The development of FLT3-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been achieved through hybridoma technology, where B cells from immunized rats and mice are used to generate the antibodies. These antibodies are then chimerized using a human IgG1 sequence to maintain the ability to interact with Fc gamma receptors (FcgRs), which are also expressed on AML blasts. The chimeric antibodies exhibit high protein stability and varying binding affinities to recombinant FLT3 protein, with dissociation constants ranging from 11.5 ng/mL to 3981 ng/mL (ASH Publications; ScienceDirect).

## Community Preferences in Research

The research community has shown a preference for FLT3 antibodies that demonstrate high specificity, stability, and internalization capabilities. The 20D9-ADC, for instance, has been favored due to its potent antileukemic strategy, especially when combined with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like midostaurin. This combination therapy has been shown to reduce aggressive AML cells below the detection limit, indicating a strong synergy between the ADC and TKI (PubMed; ASH Publications).

Another aspect that influences community preference is the ability of FLT3 antibodies to target the receptor independent of mutations. This broadens the therapeutic scope of the antibodies, making them applicable to a wider range of AML cases. The 20D9-ADC, for example, has been designed to target FLT3 regardless of the presence of ITD or TKD mutations, which is a significant advantage in the treatment of AML (ScienceDirect).

## Documented Use Cases and Demonstrated Utility

The utility of FLT3 antibodies has been well-documented in various studies. The 20D9-ADC, in particular, has been evaluated for its cytotoxic effects on AML cell lines and patient-derived xenograft AML cells. The ADC's efficacy has been further demonstrated in AML xenograft models, where it led to significant tumor reduction and complete remission in some cases. These findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of FLT3-targeting ADCs as a promising strategy for AML therapy (Thermo Fisher Scientific; PubMed).

In addition to ADCs, FLT3 antibodies have been explored in combination with other therapeutic agents. The combination of 20D9-ADC with midostaurin has shown strong synergy, leading to enhanced antileukemic effects. This combination approach has the potential to improve outcomes for patients with FLT3-ITD-positive AML, offering a more effective treatment strategy compared to monotherapies (ASH Publications).

Furthermore, the development of FLT3 antibodies has been instrumental in the advancement of immunotherapy for AML. Fc-optimized FLT3 antibodies have shown promising anti-leukemic activity with a favorable toxicity profile, suggesting their potential as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for AML. The ability of these antibodies to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and their compatibility with other therapeutic agents, such as demethylating agents, underscore their versatility and therapeutic potential (BioMed Central; Nature).

## Conclusion

FLT3 antibodies represent a significant advancement in the targeted treatment of AML and other hematological malignancies. The development of antibodies like 20D9-ADC has opened new avenues for therapeutic intervention, demonstrating potent antileukemic effects in preclinical models. The research community's preference for FLT3 antibodies is influenced by their specificity, stability, and the potential for combination therapies. Documented use cases have proven the utility of these antibodies, particularly in the context of AML, where they have shown the ability to induce tumor reduction and remission. As research continues to evolve, FLT3 antibodies are poised to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of AML and potentially other cancers.

## Introduction

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in the normal development of hematopoietic stem cells and the immune system. Mutations in the FLT3 gene, particularly internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD), are among the most common genetic aberrations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with a poor prognosis (Gilliland & Griffin, 2002; Smith et al., 2012). The identification of FLT3 as a therapeutic target has led to the development of FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i), which have shown promise in treating AML. However, the emergence of resistance to these inhibitors has raised questions about the druggability of FLT3. This report examines the challenges in targeting FLT3, the research efforts to overcome these challenges, and potential future strategies that may enhance the druggability of FLT3.

## The Challenge of FLT3 Druggability

The concept of "druggability" refers to the likelihood that a target can be modulated by a small molecule in a way that is therapeutically beneficial. FLT3 has been considered a druggable target due to its kinase activity, which can be inhibited by small molecules. However, the development of resistance to FLT3i has complicated this assessment.

### Resistance Mechanisms

Resistance to FLT3i can arise through several mechanisms, including point mutations in the FLT3 gene, activation of alternative signaling pathways, and protective effects from the bone marrow microenvironment (Traer et al., 2012). The "gatekeeper" mutation F691L, for instance, has shown universal resistance to all currently available FLT3i (NCBI, 2023). Additionally, the metabolism of FLT3i can be affected by cytochrome P450 3A4 expressed by bone marrow stromal cells and pharmacological interactions with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (NCBI, 2023).

### Research Efforts to Overcome Resistance

#### First- and Second-Generation FLT3 Inhibitors

The first-generation FLT3 inhibitors, such as midostaurin, and second-generation inhibitors, like quizartinib and gilteritinib, have been approved for use in AML. However, their efficacy is limited by the development of resistance. Research has shown that FLT3-ITD mutations are predictive of refractoriness after treatment with some FLT3i, such as crenolanib, but not others, like gilteritinib (NCBI, 2023).

#### Combination Therapies

Combination therapies have been explored to overcome resistance to FLT3i. These include combinations with chemotherapy, other targeted agents, and multitarget agents. For example, venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, has been combined with FLT3i in preclinical and clinical studies (Nature, 2023). Other combinations have involved proteasome inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, and immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T-cell therapies (NCBI, 2023).

#### Novel Compounds and Multitarget Inhibitors

New compounds and multitarget inhibitors are being developed to bypass resistance. These include compounds like 17, 8r, and 5o, which have shown activity against resistant mutations in preclinical studies (NCBI, 2023). Clinical trials are evaluating multitarget inhibitors such as dubermatinib, nintedanib, and CG-806, as well as FLT3 degraders like LWY713, which induce proteasome-dependent degradation of FLT3 (PubMed, 2023).

### Unexplored Methods

Despite extensive research, there are potential methods that have not yet been fully explored in the context of FLT3 druggability:

1. **Covalent Inhibitors**: Covalent inhibitors, such as FF-10101, which bind irreversibly to FLT3, could potentially overcome resistance by targeting the kinase in a way that is not affected by common resistance mutations (NCBI, 2023).

2. **Allosteric Inhibitors**: Allosteric inhibitors that modulate FLT3 activity without competing with ATP at the active site could offer a novel approach to overcome resistance.

3. **Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitors**: Targeting the interactions between FLT3 and other proteins involved in its signaling pathway could be a strategy to inhibit its function indirectly.

4. **Gene Therapy**: Gene editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 could be used to correct FLT3 mutations at the DNA level, although this approach faces significant technical and ethical challenges.

5. **Immunotherapy**: Expanding the use of FLT3-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies could provide a way to target FLT3-expressing leukemic cells directly.

## Conclusion

FLT3 has been a challenging target due to the development of resistance to FLT3i. However, it is not considered undruggable. The research has demonstrated that while resistance mechanisms are complex, they can be overcome through the development of new compounds, combination therapies, and innovative approaches such as protein degradation strategies. Future research should focus on exploring uncharted methods such as covalent and allosteric inhibitors, as well as leveraging advances in gene therapy and immunotherapy. The continued evolution of FLT3-targeted therapies holds promise for improving outcomes for patients with FLT3-mutated AML.

## Introduction

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in the normal development of hematopoietic stem cells and the immune system. However, mutations in the FLT3 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a type of cancer characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. This report delves into the evidence supporting the causative role of FLT3 in disease, particularly AML, and elucidates the specific mechanisms by which FLT3 mutations contribute to leukemogenesis.

## FLT3 Mutations and Disease Causation

FLT3 mutations are among the most common genetic alterations observed in AML, present in approximately 30% of newly diagnosed patients (Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37190240/). These mutations are broadly categorized into internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD) mutations. The FLT3-ITD mutation is particularly significant due to its association with a higher disease burden and inferior overall survival, attributed to high relapse rates after remission is achieved.

### Evidence of FLT3's Role in AML

The FLT3-ITD mutation leads to constitutive activation of the FLT3 receptor, which means that the receptor is persistently signaling even in the absence of its ligand. This aberrant signaling results in uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival, hallmarks of cancer. Studies have shown that FLT3-ITD mutations are associated with a poor prognosis in AML, with a higher likelihood of relapse and a shorter overall survival compared to patients without this mutation (Source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11912-023-01389-2).

Furthermore, the presence of FLT3-ITD mutations has been linked to specific clinical features such as elevated white blood cell counts, which is indicative of a more aggressive disease phenotype (Source: https://ash.confex.com/ash/2023/webprogram/Paper184582.html). The prognostic significance of FLT3-ITD mutations has been recognized in the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations, which have undergone revisions to reflect the impact of FLT3-ITD allelic ratio on risk stratification in AML (Source: https://ash.confex.com/ash/2023/webprogram/Paper184582.html).

## Molecular Mechanism of Action of FLT3

FLT3 is composed of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane helix, a juxtamembrane (JM) domain, and a kinase domain. In its inactive state, the JM domain binds to the kinase domain, stabilizing the activation loop in a closed configuration. Upon binding of the FLT3 ligand, the receptor dimerizes, leading to phosphorylation of the JM domains. This phosphorylation displaces the JM domain from its autoinhibitory position, allowing the activation loop to adopt an open conformation and revealing the ATP binding site (Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41408-022-00687-5).

### Activation of Downstream Signaling Pathways

The activation of FLT3 leads to the downstream signaling through pathways such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and STAT5, which are critical for cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41408-022-00687-5). In the case of FLT3-ITD mutations, the receptor is constitutively active, resulting in continuous activation of these pathways without the need for ligand binding. This persistent signaling drives the leukemic phenotype by promoting uncontrolled growth and resistance to apoptosis.

### FLT3-ITD and Cellular Localization

The FLT3-ITD mutation can also affect the cellular localization of the receptor. Normally, FLT3 is localized to the plasma membrane, but the ITD mutation can result in retention of the receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which may contribute to altered signaling dynamics (Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37190162/).

### Resistance to FLT3 Inhibitors

Despite the development of FLT3 inhibitors, which have improved clinical outcomes, resistance to these drugs is a significant challenge. Resistance mechanisms include secondary mutations that disrupt inhibitor-target interactions, activation of alternative signaling pathways, and changes in the bone marrow microenvironment that protect leukemic cells from drug-induced apoptosis (Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9454516/).

## Conclusion

The evidence clearly demonstrates that FLT3 mutations, particularly FLT3-ITD, play a causative role in the development and progression of AML by constitutively activating signaling pathways that promote leukemogenesis. The FLT3-ITD mutation is associated with a more aggressive disease course and poorer clinical outcomes. Although FLT3 inhibitors have provided a targeted therapeutic approach, resistance remains a significant hurdle, underscoring the need for continued research into combination therapies and novel treatment strategies.

## Introduction

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a devastating hematological malignancy characterized by the rapid proliferation of abnormal myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood, leading to ineffective hematopoiesis and suppression of normal blood cell production. The discovery of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations, particularly the internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD), has been a significant advancement in understanding the pathogenesis of AML. These mutations are associated with a poor prognosis due to their role in driving the proliferation and survival of leukemic cells. Consequently, FLT3 has become a prime target for therapeutic intervention. Despite the initial promise, clinical trials involving FLT3 inhibitors have faced several challenges, leading to failures in some cases. This report delves into the reasons behind these clinical failures, the properties of the therapeutics involved, and the stages at which these failures occurred.

## FLT3 Inhibitors: Clinical Trial Outcomes and Failures

FLT3 inhibitors have been developed with the aim of targeting the FLT3 mutations in AML patients. However, the clinical responses to FLT3 inhibitors have not been as successful as initially hoped. Several FLT3 inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials, including midostaurin, sorafenib, quizartinib, and gilteritinib, among others. Despite the approval of some FLT3 inhibitors for clinical use, resistance to these agents has emerged as a significant hurdle, leading to relapse and treatment failure.

### Reasons for Clinical Failures

#### Inadequate Target Inhibition

One of the primary reasons for the failure of FLT3 inhibitors is the inability to sustainably inhibit FLT3 in vivo. Clinical trials have demonstrated that while FLT3 was inhibited, it was only transiently reduced to less than 20% of baseline, which is insufficient for a durable clinical response (PMC2673122). This transient inhibition suggests that the pharmacokinetic properties of the inhibitors may not allow for the sustained exposure necessary to effectively suppress FLT3 activity.

#### Resistance Mechanisms

The development of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors is a multifaceted problem. Resistance can arise due to on-target mutations, such as the gatekeeper residue mutation F691L, which reduces drug affinity and leads to shorter clinical responses (PMC9298189). Additionally, off-target mutations and alterations in signaling pathways downstream of FLT3 contribute to resistance. For instance, mutations in RAS and IDH genes have been associated with refractoriness to FLT3 inhibitors (PMC9454516).

#### Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Challenges

Pharmacokinetic failures have been cited as a possible explanation for the lack of success with FLT3 inhibitors. Effective, sustained FLT3 inhibition requires continuous exposure to the drug at concentrations sufficient to inhibit FLT3 autophosphorylation significantly. However, achieving and maintaining these drug levels in patients has proven challenging (PMC2673122).

#### Polyclonal Nature of Resistance

The resistance to FLT3 inhibitors has been confirmed to be polyclonal, involving various factors such as microenvironmental influences, alterations in glutamine metabolism, cytoskeleton remodeling, and hyperactivation of several downstream pathways of the FLT3 receptor (PMC9454516). This polyclonal nature makes it difficult to overcome resistance with a single-target approach.

### Properties of FLT3 Inhibitors Leading to Failure

FLT3 inhibitors are classified into first- and second-generation based on their specificity for FLT3, and into type I and type II based on their mechanism of interaction with FLT3. The properties of these inhibitors, including their specificity, potency, and ability to bind to the FLT3 receptor, have significant implications for their clinical success.

#### Specificity and Potency

First-generation FLT3 inhibitors are broad-spectrum, multikinase inhibitors, which may lead to off-target effects and toxicities. In contrast, next-generation FLT3 inhibitors are designed to be more specific and potent, with fewer associated toxicities. However, even with improved specificity and potency, resistance mechanisms can still lead to treatment failure (s41375-018-0357-9).

#### Binding Affinity and Resistance

Mutations that lower the drug's affinity to FLT3, such as the F691L mutation, have been particularly challenging to target. Some inhibitors, like FF-10101, which covalently binds to a cysteine moiety at C695, have been developed to mitigate on-target resistance mechanisms. Preclinical studies have shown promise, but the clinical efficacy of such irreversible inhibitors remains to be fully established (PMC9298189).

### Stages of Clinical Development Failures

Failures of FLT3 inhibitors have occurred at various stages of clinical development. For instance, the trial of KW-2449 was terminated during accrual to dose level 7, not due to toxicity but because the pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that effective FLT3 inhibition could be better achieved with a different dosing scheme (PMC2673122). Other inhibitors, such as lestaurtinib and KW-2449, have been discontinued from clinical development due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties or lack of improved clinical outcomes (PMC5600895).

## Conclusion

The clinical development of FLT3 inhibitors has faced significant challenges, including inadequate target inhibition, resistance mechanisms, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic limitations, and the polyclonal nature of resistance. These factors have contributed to the clinical failures of FLT3 inhibitors at various stages of development. While some FLT3 inhibitors have been approved for clinical use, the emergence of resistance highlights the need for continued research into combination therapies and novel agents that can overcome these hurdles. The development of multitarget strategies and the use of FLT3 inhibitors in combination with other agents may offer a path forward to improve efficacy and overcome resistance in AML treatment.

## Introduction

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the rapid proliferation of abnormal myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood. The discovery of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations, particularly the internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations, has been pivotal in understanding the pathogenesis of AML and has led to the development of FLT3 inhibitors as targeted therapies. Despite the initial success of FLT3 inhibitors, resistance and relapse remain significant challenges, necessitating the development of novel therapeutics with improved profiles to enhance clinical outcomes (Darici et al., 2020; Takahashi, 2011; Gilliland & Griffin, 2002; Hayakawa et al., 2000).

## Current Landscape of FLT3 Inhibitors

FLT3 inhibitors are classified into first- and second-generation agents based on their selectivity and potency. First-generation inhibitors, such as lestaurtinib, sunitinib, midostaurin, and sorafenib, have multi-kinase activity, leading to off-target effects and increased toxicities. Second-generation inhibitors, including gilteritinib, quizartinib, and crenolanib, offer higher selectivity for FLT3, potentially resulting in greater clinical efficacy and fewer side effects. However, resistance to these inhibitors, driven by various mechanisms, limits their long-term effectiveness (Darici et al., 2020; Takahashi, 2011; Gilliland & Griffin, 2002; Hayakawa et al., 2000).

## Pathways for Differentiation in FLT3 Therapeutics

### Targeting Resistance Mechanisms

To improve the therapeutic profile of FLT3 modulators, it is crucial to address resistance mechanisms. Resistance can arise from FLT3 secondary mutations, activation of alternative signaling pathways, and changes in the tumor microenvironment. Novel FLT3 inhibitors and dual inhibitors are being developed to overcome resistance, with some in pre-clinical studies or early-phase clinical trials. Combinatorial approaches, such as combining FLT3 inhibitors with agents targeting altered signaling molecules, anti-apoptotic molecules, or epigenetic targets, are also being explored (Darici et al., 2020).

### Enhancing Selectivity and Potency

Next-generation FLT3 inhibitors aim to be more specific and potent, with a reduced likelihood of off-target effects. These agents may also induce myeloid differentiation and exhibit greater clinical activity as monotherapies. By improving selectivity, these inhibitors could minimize toxicity and enhance patient tolerability, potentially leading to better adherence and outcomes (Darici et al., 2020).

### Dual Inhibition Strategies

Dual inhibitors target FLT3 and other kinases or pathways implicated in AML pathogenesis. By simultaneously inhibiting FLT3 and synergistic signaling molecules, these agents may improve efficacy and overcome resistance. Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of these novel treatment strategies (Darici et al., 2020).

### Immunotherapeutic Approaches

Beyond small molecule inhibitors, therapeutic modalities such as antibody-based FLT3 targeted therapies, immune cell-mediated targeting strategies, and approaches targeting downstream signaling pathways and FLT3 translation are being developed. These strategies may offer alternative mechanisms of action and could be combined with FLT3 inhibitors to enhance therapeutic efficacy (Darici et al., 2020).

### Combinatorial Treatment Approaches

Combining FLT3 inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy has been a critical strategy in clinical trials. However, the addition of agents that inhibit altered signaling pathways or other molecular targets could be synergistically effective, particularly in FLT3 inhibitor-resistant FLT3-ITD AML. The combination of FLT3 inhibitors with pro-apoptotic agents, such as venetoclax, has shown promise in pre-clinical models and early-phase clinical trials, suggesting a potential path for improving therapeutic outcomes (Darici et al., 2020).

## Clinical Trial Strategies

### Patient Stratification

An essential aspect of clinical trial design is the stratification of patients based on their genetic makeup. Understanding the resistance profiles of type I and type II FLT3 inhibitors allows for the selection of an appropriate treatment strategy tailored to the genetic characteristics of each patient's AML (Darici et al., 2020).

### Early Identification of Resistance

Monitoring for the emergence of resistance during FLT3 inhibitor therapy is critical. By identifying molecular mechanisms of resistance early, clinicians can adjust treatment strategies preemptively, potentially preventing relapse and improving survival rates (Darici et al., 2020).

### Incorporating Novel Agents

Clinical trials should incorporate novel FLT3 inhibitors and dual-target inhibitors to assess their ability to reduce drug resistance and increase response rates. Trials should also evaluate the efficacy of these agents in combination with approved therapies to determine the most effective treatment regimens (Darici et al., 2020).

### Addressing Tumor Heterogeneity

AML is a genetically heterogeneous disease, and FLT3 mutations can evolve under therapeutic pressure. Clinical trials must consider the dynamic nature of AML and the potential for clonal evolution, which may impact the efficacy of FLT3-targeted therapies. Strategies that address tumor heterogeneity may lead to more durable responses and improved survival outcomes (Darici et al., 2020).

## Conclusion

The development of FLT3 modulating therapeutics for AML has made significant progress, yet challenges remain in achieving long-term efficacy and overcoming resistance. The path for differentiation and improvement of therapeutic profiles involves targeting resistance mechanisms, enhancing selectivity and potency, developing dual inhibitors, exploring immunotherapeutic approaches, and employing combinatorial treatment strategies. Clinical trial designs must incorporate patient stratification, early identification of resistance, novel agents, and address tumor heterogeneity to maximize the potential of FLT3 inhibitors. With continued research and innovation, it is hoped that more specific and durable FLT3-ITD therapies will become available, improving outcomes for patients with FLT3-mutated AML.

## Introduction

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The FLT3 ligand is a growth factor that binds to and activates FLT3. Mutations in the FLT3 gene, such as internal tandem duplications (ITD), are associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are a target for therapeutic intervention. The availability and sourcing of FLT3 protein are crucial for research and development in the field of hematology and oncology. This report provides an in-depth analysis of commercial sources for FLT3 protein, focusing on the procurement options for specific quantities such as 100 µg and 10 µg, and the potential costs associated with these quantities.
